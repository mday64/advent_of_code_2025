# Points Referencing Their Circuit

Would it go faster if each point had a reference to the Circuit that contains it?
Then it wouldn't have to search through all of the circuits.

I think that means I would have to use Rc's Weak reference type.

# Union-find

This is apparently a case of a union-find algorithm.  Investigate how that algorithm works, and either find a crate that implements it, or implement it myself.
